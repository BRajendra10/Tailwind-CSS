# ðŸŒŸ Tailwind CSS Profile Card UI - First Step into Utility-First Design

This is my very first project using Tailwind CSS â€” a utility-first front-end framework that completely changed how I approach UI development.

## ðŸŽ¨ What I Built

- A responsive Profile Card UI that showcases a modern, clean layout with real-time styling using Tailwindâ€™s utility classes. It demonstrates:
- A header with bold background and typography.
- A circular profile image overlapping the header.
- User bio with social stats (followers/following).
- Responsive, mobile-friendly layout using Flexbox.
- Clean, minimalistic iconography with Remix Icons.

## ðŸš€ Why Tailwind?

- Unlike traditional CSS, Tailwind lets me:
- Style directly in HTML using utility classes.
- Avoid writing custom CSS for most parts.
- Focus more on design and responsiveness.
- Build faster and iterate quicker.
