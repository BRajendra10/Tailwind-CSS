# ðŸŒŸ User Card UI

This is my very first project using Tailwind CSS â€” a utility-first front-end framework that completely changed how I approach UI development.

## ðŸŽ¨ What I Built

I built a responsive profile card UI that features a modern, clean layout, entirely styled using Tailwind CSS utility classes. The card includes a bold header section with strong typography and a circular profile image that overlaps the header, creating a visually engaging effect. Below the header, there's a short user bio that introduces the individual in a compact and readable format.

The layout is designed to be fully responsive and mobile-friendly, using Flexbox for smooth alignment across various screen sizes. Additionally, I integrated clean and minimalistic icons from Remix Icons to enhance the visual clarity and maintain a sleek, professional look throughout the component.
